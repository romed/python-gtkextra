Welcome to the Python bindings for GtkExtra!

GtkExtra  is a  set of  widgets for  the GIMP  Toolkit, aka  GTK+. It
provides  a spreadsheet-like matrix  widget, widgets  for 2-D  and 3-D
graphing and  several other widgets.  GtkExtra's home  page is located
at http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net/.

The Python bindings for GtkExtra  allow you to use the GtkExtra widget
set in  programs written  in the powerful  object-oriented programming
language Python.  Look at http://www.python.org/ for information about
Python.

The Python  bindings for GtkExtra  require Numerical Python,  which is
available  at http://numpy.sourceforge.net/, and  PyGTK, which  can be
found at http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/.
